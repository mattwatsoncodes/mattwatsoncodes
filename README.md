### Hi I'm Matt Watson ðŸ‘‹

Hello there! Iâ€™m Matt Watson â€” a developer, father, and husband, remotely coding from the charming landscapes of Yorkshire, UK. 

Iâ€™ve been crafting wonderful things with WordPress since 2006 and spinning webs (the good kind) since 1996 â€” yes, I survived the dial-up era! Solving (and occasionally committing) WordPress-based crimes, I juggle code by day and dad jokes by night. Remote worker since 2014, Iâ€™ve mastered the art of debugging in my slippers while keeping the coffee industry in business.
